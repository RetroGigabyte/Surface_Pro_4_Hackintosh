# Surface Pro 4 & Surface Book (gen1) Hackintosh
This provides the ability to boot the Surface Pro 4 &amp; Surface Book (gen1) to macOS as a hackintosh. This may also work on the Surface Pro 5 &amp; 6 as well as newer Surface Book generations with some minor modifications. 


The instructions and EFI files will be coming soon. You can look forward to:
1. Working battery stats
2. Power Management
3. Touch Sreen working! Yes you read that correctly!
4. Much more!


Touch is Technically supported in the posted EFI files however it requires [@Xiashangning's IPTSDaemon](https://github.com/Xiashangning/IPTSDaemon) in order to work. Keep in mind that at the moment IPTSDaemon won't work until it is updated for "FMT 9.0.0". Until FMT is updated touch will not work. All other features appear to be working. The posted EFI is heavily based off other work but modified to clean up code and improve reliability which will include removing dependence on a Hacky Modified DSDT (credits will be posted as soon as possible). I will be posting a further modified & cleaned up EFI at a later date along with instructions.


Star or watch this github repository to be notified of updates coming soon.
